	The main program of the project is ourProject.py. The writers of the program are Amshah Mushtaq and Emily Burda. In order to run the program, first make sure IDLE (python 3.8.1) is downloaded to the computer. Open the file ourProject.py and click “Run Module” to run the program. Once the program is running, the user will first be asked their name in the Python 3.8.1 Shell. The user should promptly enter their name. Afterwards, the instructions.txt file will open up in the Shell. This will explain to the user how to proceed with the Motivation Test and will outline the scale of one to five for the questions. The user will be asked if they are ready to proceed. If the user says “no,” they will be prompted to reread the directions in the Shell. If the user says “yes,”  the user will be presented 35 questions that should be evaluated using a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 means “I agree” and 1 means “I disagree.” 
	After the user successfully answers all 35 questions, a message will appear on the Shell based on their motivation level and total score. There are a total of 175 points the user can. The total score is a sum of the points earned per question. Based on the user’s total score, the program will determine the user’s motivation level. The user can have high motivation (141 to 175 points), average motivation (106 to 140 points), medium motivation (71 to 105 points), or below average motivation (35 to 70 points). For each of the four motivation levels, a specific message is written and will appear in the Shell based on the user’s total score. Each message has a specific response to the user’s score, which lists their motivation level, some tips, and words of encouragement. 
	After the message appears, the user will be asked a few more specific questions in the shell. These are questions, such as their favorite snack, exercise, and friend’s name. This is the madLib portion of the program. Once the user enters their responses, a personalized message will appear in the shell with advice and tips to increase motivation. Personalization is used in this aspect to give specific examples to the user and to further connect with the user. 
	The user will then be asked whether they want to know their total score and percentage of motivation. As writers of the program, we understand that not all users will want to know their numerical score, as that may be more hurtful than helpful for some. However, if the user wants to know their total score, they can respond by saying “yes,” and they will be provided with their total points and percentage of motivation. Otherwise, the user can say “no.”
	Lastly, to inform the user that they have reached the end of the Motivation Test, a graphic window will open up. In the graphic, the user will see a message saying, “Thank you for taking our Motivation Test.” To increase visual aesthetic, 80 random blue and black circles will cover the message and window. When the user clicks the window, the program will quit. This marks the end of the program.
